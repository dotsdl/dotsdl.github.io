</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This post was originally posted to Facebook. It was a&nbsp;response to a
creationist friend who posted a video of another creationist attempting
to discredit the usual set of scientific theories. I felt I should share
it for others because I'm terminally optimistic, and I needed the
outlet.</p>
<p>One&nbsp;recurring mistake made by creationists when trying to discredit
science is this: it is assumed that science must observe <strong>every</strong>
phenomenon a theory posits to take place in order for that theory to be
considered valid. When a creationist says repeatedly that &quot;there is no
evidence for THEORY X&quot;, he is oftentimes operating on his standard that
<strong>every</strong> prediction of that theory must be tested. This is unreasonable
for science to progress; worse, it's shown itself to be <strong>unnecessary</strong>.
The value of theory is that it is better than a library of observations;
it gives greater insight into what's actually happening.</p>
<p>To use an analogy: many of my students in an introductory physics course
spent&nbsp;the beginning of the semester doing physics problems with
arithmetic. They were literally throwing numbers around in ways that
&quot;made sense&quot; to them until they arrived at an (often wrong) answer.&nbsp;To
break them of this, I began asking questions that required some higher
level thought. Instead of &quot;how high on the wall does the projectile
strike&quot; given some set of initial conditions, I asked &quot;what is the
minimum speed with which the projectile must be fired in order to go
over the wall.&quot; Those that tried arithmetic quickly realized they'd have
to trial-and-error it to get the answer, which would be silly.</p>
<p>The ones that solved the problem instead used the theory they had
learned in class (2D kinematics, a purely descriptive part of classical
mechanics), algebraically finding the speed I asked for. I then asked
them how this speed changes with firing distance, and they could answer
this question by looking at the symbolic answer. I even asked them how
quickly this speed changes with a change in firing angle, effectively
requiring a derivative.</p>
<p>When creationists demand evidence for every single facet or prediction
of a theory, they are demanding that science do the arithmetic...<strong>for
every variation of the problem the theory is addressing</strong>. This is
unreasonable. Worse, it doesn't really tell us much more information
about the set of phenomena we are addressing, just like solving the same
problem over and over again with different numbers doesn't really give
insight into what's actually happening.</p>
<p>With a finite number of scientists working on a much larger set of
problems (and growing, as we are able to probe more and more of nature),
our limited resources are better spent proving the principles and then
moving on, using those principles to discover ever more. Quantum
mechanics has probably less direct evidence for it than biological
evolution, but we didn't waste time endlessly testing every boring case
the theory presents. Instead, we took advantage of it to build materials
that now allow the computer you are using to post emoticons on Facebook.</p>
<p>So, thank a theory...or something. And have a nice evening.</p>
