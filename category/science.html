</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I last wrote a blog post, and this is for a couple
(very good) reasons. First, I&#8217;ve been hard at work on a <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/dotsdl/MDSynthesis">software package for
making molecular dynamics data exploration more manageable</a>. More on that in another post to
come soon. Second, I had a major conference to prepare for, this being the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.biophysics.org/2015meeting">Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Baltimore</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at this meeting about our recent work on <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201411219">sodium proton
antiporters</a>. The talk was
well-received and the questions allowed me to clarify details that I probably
flew through during the 12 minutes I had to speak. I&#8217;m very happy to have
had the opportunity to share my work to a full&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>Though the talk was a success, for me this last week was more a personal test
in how quickly I can produce new data and distill useful information from it. I
spent a significant amount of time over winter break and the first bit of
January restructuring my workflow, and I am now significantly faster at this.
It isn&#8217;t just pipeline, either; the new approach allows me to effectively
explore my data to generate new inferences and quickly test&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>As an example: I discovered what would become a key element of my talk on
Saturday night, and I gave that talk on Monday. It was a bit too much like
playing with fire than I&#8217;d like to risk in future meetings, but it was
well-worth it this time. The fast turn-around itself is encouraging, since it&#8217;s
looking to be an indication of a very productive&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>The meeting also brought me in contact with a host of great peers (and giants)
in the community. I&#8217;m glad I got to meet the faces to so many names in such
a short period of time. I had great discussions and made new&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be spending the next few days relaxing in <span class="caps">D.C.</span> with some friends, but
I&#8217;m looking forward to getting back to the lab. Plenty of fresh ideas to work
with in the coming year. Despite being physically exhausted, I am Very pleased
with my time in&nbsp;Baltimore.</p>
