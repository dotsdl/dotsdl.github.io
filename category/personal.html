</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I severely underestimated the degree of befuddled I would experience following
the end of my PhD.
After spending over half a decade in the academic world, with half of that
fully intending to leave it for a career in industry, I found myself saddled
with a new crisis of identity I did not anticipate.
Despite all my preparation over the years, mentally and otherwise, I felt&nbsp;adrift.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a year since then, and only now do I feel like I&#8217;m starting to find a
footing, something resembling solid earth.
The post-defense hangover is morphing into clarity of purpose, but I had to
stumble around the living room through an afternoon that lasted months for it
to happen.
I can&#8217;t help but wonder if this is a common experience for others?
I would love to hear your thoughts if you (yes, you!) have gone through a
similar&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read in many places that people in academia exhibit a disproportionate
incidence of mental health disorders over the general population.
Whether this is due to the nature of the work, or due to the self-selection of
(often eccentric by nature) personalities it attracts, or both, is still an
open question.  But coming out of it, I learned there were many aspects of my
personality that were ill-suited to the world outside.  I also learned how
dependent I was on the environment for holding together whatever it was that
was there, and without that glue, I felt like my sense of self was falling into
pieces around&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>2017 was a weird year.
This is an understatement for many reasons, and I&#8217;m certain for many people
besides myself.
I sought to find identity in new relationships, new activities, new things.
In all these areas, in different ways, I failed.
And now, at the end of 2017, I stand at the precipice of a new year with much
of the old already cleared away.
I would have expected to be in a deep depression from this, but instead I feel
an internal peace and joy that I can&#8217;t quite put words&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started the process of becoming my own friend.
I believe for a long time I&#8217;ve avoided a friendship with myself, a real respect
and care for the person I&#8217;m stuck with for life.
I did my damnedest to distract myself from his inadequacies, his failures, his
stupidity, often attempting to do so with more stupidity.
This of course didn&#8217;t work.
But out of this mess I believe I&#8217;ve found a new love, and his name is&nbsp;David.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was not the usual retrospective one might post on a personal blog.
It&#8217;s also not something I&#8217;d normally share, but frankly, I think it worth
sharing.
We all try to project an image of being &#8220;put-together&#8221; at all times, to keep up
appearances, to show maturity.
But we&#8217;re not always put-together, and many of us may regularly be
high-functioning dysfunctionals in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling well for 2018.
I look forward to spending it with all of you, another year around the star on
this lovely rock we call home.
Cheers to new&nbsp;adventures.</p>
