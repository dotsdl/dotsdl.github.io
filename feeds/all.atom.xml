&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/"&gt;Titus Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Software Carpentry is a
non-profit volunteer organization that puts on &amp;quot;bootcamps&amp;quot; at institutions all
over the world to teach best practices for building and using software to do
science efficiently and reproducibly. The three-day training helped to improve
my own awareness of how people learn the technical skills we teach. I also met
many great people doing awesome work in the open science&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, I gave a five-minute lightning lesson as an introduction to Python
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://third-bit.com/"&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, completing the final requirement
for becoming an instructor. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to teaching bootcamps here at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt; this year and next, and hopefully getting out a bit to teach some elsewhere
in the country. I also hope to contribute to the efforts of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://datacarpentry.org/"&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; with material specific to working with molecular
dynamics data. I&amp;#8217;d be keen to dicuss this topic with anyone else who&amp;#8217;s
interested. There&amp;#8217;s a lot that could be done on this&amp;nbsp;front.&lt;/p&gt;

(very good) reasons. First, I&amp;#8217;ve been hard at work on a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/dotsdl/MDSynthesis"&gt;software package for
making molecular dynamics data exploration more manageable&lt;/a&gt;. More on that in another post to
come soon. Second, I had a major conference to prepare for, this being the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biophysics.org/2015meeting"&gt;Biophysical Society Annual Meeting in Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk at this meeting about our recent work on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201411219"&gt;sodium proton
antiporters&lt;/a&gt;. The talk was
well-received and the questions allowed me to clarify details that I probably
flew through during the 12 minutes I had to speak. I&amp;#8217;m very happy to have
had the opportunity to share my work to a full&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the talk was a success, for me this last week was more a personal test
in how quickly I can produce new data and distill useful information from it. I
spent a significant amount of time over winter break and the first bit of
January restructuring my workflow, and I am now significantly faster at this.
It isn&amp;#8217;t just pipeline, either; the new approach allows me to effectively
explore my data to generate new inferences and quickly test&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example: I discovered what would become a key element of my talk on
Saturday night, and I gave that talk on Monday. It was a bit too much like
playing with fire than I&amp;#8217;d like to risk in future meetings, but it was
well-worth it this time. The fast turn-around itself is encouraging, since it&amp;#8217;s
looking to be an indication of a very productive&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting also brought me in contact with a host of great peers (and giants)
in the community. I&amp;#8217;m glad I got to meet the faces to so many names in such
a short period of time. I had great discussions and made new&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be spending the next few days relaxing in D.C., but I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to
getting back to the lab. Plenty of fresh ideas to work with in the coming year.
Despite being physically exhausted, I am very pleased with my time in&amp;nbsp;Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;

software, and education by blogging regularly on my exploits. I&amp;#8217;d previously
built a website on top of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sundial.physics.asu.edu"&gt;Sundial&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to go with that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;. I purchased a domain name through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.godaddy.com/"&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt;,
and out of convenience purchased Wordpress hosting through them as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is a fine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, but I despised writing in the built-in editor. I&amp;#8217;m
a vim nerd, and really wanted to write in plaintext in my editor of choice.
Also, I wanted to start sharing code snippets and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html"&gt;iPython notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, and Wordpress was appearing an awkward
choice at best for&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator
written in Python that uses ReStructuredText as the markup of choice
for articles. It took a little time to set up, but most of this was
spent trying to approximate my old blog&amp;#8217;s look by way of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dotsdl/pelican-bluemoon"&gt;custom theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in blogging with a statically-generated site through
pelican, start by installing the python module locally with&amp;nbsp;pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pip install --user pelican
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then build a skeleton that includes everything you need to get started&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pelican-quickstart
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican docs&lt;/a&gt; have up-to-date information
on how to&amp;nbsp;proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since pelican generates static html files, they can be cheaply hosted. In fact,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; provides free page hosting via &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dotsdl/dotsdl.github.io"&gt;repository for my site&lt;/a&gt; and edited the Makefile included
in my pelican project directory to point to it. This allows me to regenerate
and publish my static site&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
make github
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t get much easier. I&amp;#8217;m very&amp;nbsp;pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: I have added my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dotsdl/smallerthings"&gt;blog source to GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps if you&amp;#8217;re having trouble
getting something working it will be of&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;

little while now, and this blog is part of an effort to emulate his
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html"&gt;relatively conservative&lt;/a&gt;)
brand of open science. However, if it wasn&amp;#8217;t obvious from my lack of new content over
the past few months, I&amp;#8217;ve been in a bit of a rut. What&amp;nbsp;gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one thing I don&amp;#8217;t &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; the research I produce. Or, at the very
least, I don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; own it. There are my collaborators to think about,
not to mention my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;, whose ultimate permission I must obtain to openly
discuss the things we are hammering on. And in a competitive field, there is
the real fear (valid? I&amp;#8217;m not sure) of being&amp;nbsp;scooped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what to do? I think the landscape science operates in is changing, and the way science
is done &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; change in order to cope. Funding is becoming &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n11/full/nmeth.3171.html"&gt;harder to get&lt;/a&gt;.
Reproducing scientific work, even those dependent on software alone, is
difficult. And these days obtaining data is becoming less of a problem; instead,
in many fields the emerging problem is how to cope with data glut, which itself
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/"&gt;requires a new skill set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open science movement seeks in part to take the lessons from the open source
software movement and apply them to science. This is particularly salient for someone
in my field, since in simulation-based work raw and distilled data is both generated
by software. Open science finds little contradiction&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more competitive a field is, the more perceived incentive there is to keep
work bottled up until the &lt;em&gt;big reveal&lt;/em&gt; in the form of a journal publication. Rarely
this publication includes the full data set (in my field, this would mean raw simulation
trajectories and the input parameters) and all code (mainly analysis code, though
not all molecular dynamics codes are open source). What&amp;#8217;s more, the main input
to our simulations are experimental structures, and the crystallography community
is known to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; competitive. We are thus constrained by our experimentalist
collaborators&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I&amp;#8217;ll be using this space to share what I can about my work, especially
ideas with regard to software and scalable analysis (with a bent toward applications
to molecular dynamics problems). Change in science is slow, but I&amp;#8217;ll try to do my
part&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

(however poorly) the exponentially growing scientific literature. I&amp;#8217;ll
expound more on my method of choice in another post, but no matter how
fast I try to get at processing papers, new and old, one thing disrupts
my flow more than any other:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall"&gt;paywalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every scientist knows them well. You&amp;#8217;re reading papers, and you see a
detail that piques your curiosity enough to check the reference. You
then type as much of the title as you care to into Google and click on
the first link that looks like it might have a manuscript behind it. Oh
no, it&amp;#8217;s just &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed"&gt;Pubmed&lt;/a&gt;. But it
has links to the full text!&amp;nbsp;Click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly you scan for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; download link. But there&amp;#8217;s a number next to
it. &lt;strong&gt;For the low, low price of $28.00, this article could be yours!&lt;/strong&gt;
Or you could &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot; it for $4.00, whatever that&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have roughly 400 articles in my Zotero library, and it&amp;#8217;s growing fast.
Luckily I&amp;#8217;m privileged to have access to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lib.asu.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s library subscriptions for most (though
certainly not all) journals, but this requires me to engage in further
gymnastics to use the proxy server to get&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I&amp;#8217;ve pulled an article (or more likely several) into my
library, I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten the context of why I cared to find it&amp;nbsp;in the
first place. I may have jotted down a note or two, but the full moment
is lost, possibly forever. What&amp;#8217;s worse, though I may be able to scrap
most of my thoughts back together and carry on with chasing the rabbit
down the idea hole, imagine being a student at a smaller university with
a less-endowed library. That idea that led to the chase may never find
what it needs to bother&amp;nbsp;pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every paywall represents an opportunity lost, if not several. They are
plaque in the arteries of science, slowing down everyone. Luckily the
scene is changing with the efforts of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access"&gt;open access
movement&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s certainly&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

post&lt;/a&gt;,
this weekend I participated in my first &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software
Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;bootcamp. I had the
pleasure of meeting the instructors and all the other helpers involved
on Friday&amp;nbsp;over pizza and beer, and in particular spent considerable time
nerding out with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://naupaka.net/"&gt;Naupaka&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over all things vim
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf"&gt;tidy data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day 1, the topic of the morning was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. From what I understand, it was only
recently that Software Carpentry decided to add R to their curriculum.
Though I certainly learned plenty myself as I rushed about helping
participants through small problems, there is a lot of good stuff (and
plenty of potential)&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R is an analysis tool first and a programming language second. This
makes it a pragmatic choice for researchers but still a difficult one to
teach. We used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rstudio.com/"&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the
environment for introducing things, and this may have taken the edge off
for the command-line averse. I didn&amp;#8217;t get a chance to follow along with
the exercises too much myself, but I&amp;#8217;m particularly interested in
learning more about the use of factors. If anyone has any resources for
understanding what factors are, why they are useful, etc., I&amp;#8217;d love to
hear about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we switched topics to the shell, or more specifically
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. The session started well
enough, but given a distribution of participants that ranged from zero
experience to intermediate, it proved difficult to please everyone.
Also, as a note to anyone that does a bootcamp on the shell (or even any
topic): &lt;em&gt;give a motivation behind everything you demonstrate, both in
broad and immediate scope&lt;/em&gt;. Although it can be obvious why a given trick
is useful to an experienced user, the novice can often be left wondering
what benefit this has compared to what they already do to get work done.
This is especially true for the shell, since 90% of work done in the
shell is moving around a file system, which most scientists already
accomplish by clicking around a file browser. People have to see a clear
advantage to adopt new&amp;nbsp;practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 (today) started off with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;. The
instructors did well to put extensive focus on giving motivation for
git&amp;#8217;s use, given the feedback from the previous day&amp;#8217;s session on the
shell. This was especially important for git, since for many scientists
it is considered to be non-essential in the toolbox of software things.
Software Carpentry hopes to change&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist: &lt;strong&gt;git is great for more than just code.&lt;/strong&gt; Though originally
produced to address the needs of the software community, as a version
control system git works particularly well for paper writing, alone or
with collaborators. And even though git is optimal when working with
text-only files, it is perfectly happy to store away&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; you
like and version control it.&amp;nbsp;Further, pushing the materials used to
build a manuscript to a public repository host like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a great way to address the
well-acknowledged problem of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852"&gt;reproducibility in
science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the afternoon we turned our focus to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;database as our toy case for
running queries against. I was running out of steam by about this point,
and I mainly focused on helping the folks on Windows to get sqlite3
working under &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://msysgit.github.io/"&gt;Git Bash&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(not hard, but
for beginners running around the filesystem is an expensive&amp;nbsp;operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;m happy I got to help put this on and I hope to be involved
in a growing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt; community here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt; in the very near future. Assuming
space is still available, I&amp;#8217;m also hoping to attend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-davis-swc-training.html"&gt;Titus Brown&amp;#8217;s
instructor training in Davis this coming
January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone involved! Looking forward to&amp;nbsp;more!&lt;/p&gt;

It was a&amp;nbsp;response to a
creationist friend who posted a video of another creationist attempting
to discredit the usual set of scientific theories. I felt I should share
it for others because I&amp;#8217;m terminally optimistic, and I needed the&amp;nbsp;outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&amp;nbsp;recurring mistake made by creationists when trying to discredit
science is this: it is assumed that science must observe &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt;
phenomenon a theory posits to take place in order for that theory to be
considered valid. When a creationist says repeatedly that &amp;quot;there is no
evidence for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEORY&lt;/span&gt; X&amp;quot;, he is oftentimes operating on his standard that
&lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; prediction of that theory must be tested. This is unreasonable
for science to progress; worse, it&amp;#8217;s shown itself to be &lt;strong&gt;unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt;.
The value of theory is that it is better than a library of observations;
it gives greater insight into what&amp;#8217;s actually&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use an analogy: many of my students in an introductory physics course
spent&amp;nbsp;the beginning of the semester doing physics problems with
arithmetic. They were literally throwing numbers around in ways that
&amp;quot;made sense&amp;quot; to them until they arrived at an (often wrong) answer.&amp;nbsp;To
break them of this, I began asking questions that required some higher
level thought. Instead of &amp;quot;how high on the wall does the projectile
strike&amp;quot; given some set of initial conditions, I asked &amp;quot;what is the
minimum speed with which the projectile must be fired in order to go
over the wall.&amp;quot; Those that tried arithmetic quickly realized they&amp;#8217;d have
to trial-and-error it to get the answer, which would be&amp;nbsp;silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones that solved the problem instead used the theory they had
learned in class (2D kinematics, a purely descriptive part of classical
mechanics), algebraically finding the speed I asked for. I then asked
them how this speed changes with firing distance, and they could answer
this question by looking at the symbolic answer. I even asked them how
quickly this speed changes with a change in firing angle, effectively
requiring a&amp;nbsp;derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creationists demand evidence for every single facet or prediction
of a theory, they are demanding that science do the arithmetic&amp;#8230;&lt;strong&gt;for
every variation of the problem the theory is addressing&lt;/strong&gt;. This is
unreasonable. Worse, it doesn&amp;#8217;t really tell us much more information
about the set of phenomena we are addressing, just like solving the same
problem over and over again with different numbers doesn&amp;#8217;t really give
insight into what&amp;#8217;s actually&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a finite number of scientists working on a much larger set of
problems (and growing, as we are able to probe more and more of nature),
our limited resources are better spent proving the principles and then
moving on, using those principles to discover ever more. Quantum
mechanics has probably less direct evidence for it than biological
evolution, but we didn&amp;#8217;t waste time endlessly testing every boring case
the theory presents. Instead, we took advantage of it to build materials
that now allow the computer you are using to post emoticons on&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank a theory&amp;#8230;or something. And have a nice&amp;nbsp;evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;bootcamp, held
right here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt;. I will be helping with some of the sessions myself,
but otherwise I look forward to learning some R and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; skills with some
like-minded&amp;nbsp;peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, Software Carpentry is an organization that actively
works to improve the computational, programming, and data analysis
skills of scientists. This is more than necessary, because though
science often pushes the boundaries of what computing can accomplish,
good software practices are relatively rare among scientists. Version
control, code readability, and software design is becoming increasingly
important as the complexity of computational science&amp;nbsp;increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll post about my experiences after having attended the two-day
bootcamp. If you are interested in attending yourself, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://naupaka.github.io/2014-09-27-asu/"&gt;register
here&lt;/a&gt;. It should be a good&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;

and the topics of the day were mainly of&amp;nbsp;interest to only 20-year-old
me. I was just coming out as gay, learning to deal with feelings I
didn&amp;#8217;t understand. I spent a lot of time thinking about religion, and
plenty of time arguing about it with others. I didn&amp;#8217;t know much about
the world, but I was trying&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now 25, and in my fourth year of graduate school. I am invested in
my research (plenty to write about on that soon), and I am in a stable
and fulfilling relationship. Grad school started out (very) rough, but
I&amp;#8217;ve found my niche. I&amp;#8217;m generally&amp;nbsp;pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided it was appropriate to start sharing my thoughts and
experiences with others. It&amp;#8217;s not something I&amp;#8217;m used to, so it may take
a post or two before I&amp;#8217;ve found&amp;nbsp;my groove. Some posts will be about
science (both content and sociology thereof) and software development;
others will chronicle my teaching and thoughts on the state of
education. Yet others will be personal updates. I think there is space
for all of this&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;david&lt;/p&gt;
