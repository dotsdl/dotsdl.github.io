&lt;cite&gt;Titus Brown &amp;lt;http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/&amp;gt;__&lt;/cite&gt;. Software Carpentry is a
non-profit volunteer organization that puts on &amp;quot;bootcamps&amp;quot; at institutions all
over the world to teach best practices for building and using software to do
science efficiently and reproducibly. The three-day training helped to improve
my own awareness of how people learn the technical skills we teach. I also met
many great people doing awesome work in the open science&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, I gave a five-minute lightning lesson as an introduction to Python
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://third-bit.com/"&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, completing the final requirement
for becoming an instructor. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to teaching bootcamps here at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt; this year and next, and hopefully getting out a bit to teach some elsewhere
in the country. I also hope to contribute to the efforts of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://datacarpentry.org/"&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; with material specific to working with molecular
dynamics data. I&amp;#8217;d be keen to dicuss this topic with anyone else who&amp;#8217;s
interested. There&amp;#8217;s a lot that could be done on this&amp;nbsp;front.&lt;/p&gt;

post&lt;/a&gt;,
this weekend I participated in my first &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software
Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;bootcamp. I had the
pleasure of meeting the instructors and all the other helpers involved
on Friday&amp;nbsp;over pizza and beer, and in particular spent considerable time
nerding out with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://naupaka.net/"&gt;Naupaka&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over all things vim
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf"&gt;tidy data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day 1, the topic of the morning was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. From what I understand, it was only
recently that Software Carpentry decided to add R to their curriculum.
Though I certainly learned plenty myself as I rushed about helping
participants through small problems, there is a lot of good stuff (and
plenty of potential)&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R is an analysis tool first and a programming language second. This
makes it a pragmatic choice for researchers but still a difficult one to
teach. We used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rstudio.com/"&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the
environment for introducing things, and this may have taken the edge off
for the command-line averse. I didn&amp;#8217;t get a chance to follow along with
the exercises too much myself, but I&amp;#8217;m particularly interested in
learning more about the use of factors. If anyone has any resources for
understanding what factors are, why they are useful, etc., I&amp;#8217;d love to
hear about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we switched topics to the shell, or more specifically
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. The session started well
enough, but given a distribution of participants that ranged from zero
experience to intermediate, it proved difficult to please everyone.
Also, as a note to anyone that does a bootcamp on the shell (or even any
topic): &lt;em&gt;give a motivation behind everything you demonstrate, both in
broad and immediate scope&lt;/em&gt;. Although it can be obvious why a given trick
is useful to an experienced user, the novice can often be left wondering
what benefit this has compared to what they already do to get work done.
This is especially true for the shell, since 90% of work done in the
shell is moving around a file system, which most scientists already
accomplish by clicking around a file browser. People have to see a clear
advantage to adopt new&amp;nbsp;practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 (today) started off with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;. The
instructors did well to put extensive focus on giving motivation for
git&amp;#8217;s use, given the feedback from the previous day&amp;#8217;s session on the
shell. This was especially important for git, since for many scientists
it is considered to be non-essential in the toolbox of software things.
Software Carpentry hopes to change&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist: &lt;strong&gt;git is great for more than just code.&lt;/strong&gt; Though originally
produced to address the needs of the software community, as a version
control system git works particularly well for paper writing, alone or
with collaborators. And even though git is optimal when working with
text-only files, it is perfectly happy to store away&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; you
like and version control it.&amp;nbsp;Further, pushing the materials used to
build a manuscript to a public repository host like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a great way to address the
well-acknowledged problem of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852"&gt;reproducibility in
science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the afternoon we turned our focus to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;database as our toy case for
running queries against. I was running out of steam by about this point,
and I mainly focused on helping the folks on Windows to get sqlite3
working under &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://msysgit.github.io/"&gt;Git Bash&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(not hard, but
for beginners running around the filesystem is an expensive&amp;nbsp;operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;m happy I got to help put this on and I hope to be involved
in a growing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt; community here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt; in the very near future. Assuming
space is still available, I&amp;#8217;m also hoping to attend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-davis-swc-training.html"&gt;Titus Brown&amp;#8217;s
instructor training in Davis this coming
January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone involved! Looking forward to&amp;nbsp;more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;bootcamp, held
right here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASU&lt;/span&gt;. I will be helping with some of the sessions myself,
but otherwise I look forward to learning some R and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; skills with some
like-minded&amp;nbsp;peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, Software Carpentry is an organization that actively
works to improve the computational, programming, and data analysis
skills of scientists. This is more than necessary, because though
science often pushes the boundaries of what computing can accomplish,
good software practices are relatively rare among scientists. Version
control, code readability, and software design is becoming increasingly
important as the complexity of computational science&amp;nbsp;increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll post about my experiences after having attended the two-day
bootcamp. If you are interested in attending yourself, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://naupaka.github.io/2014-09-27-asu/"&gt;register
here&lt;/a&gt;. It should be a good&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
