software, and education by blogging regularly on my exploits. I&amp;#8217;d previously
built a website on top of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wordpress.org/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sundial.physics.asu.edu"&gt;Sundial&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to go with that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;. I purchased a domain name through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.godaddy.com/"&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt;,
and out of convenience purchased Wordpress hosting through them as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is a fine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, but I despised writing in the built-in editor. I&amp;#8217;m
a vim nerd, and really wanted to write in plaintext in my editor of choice.
Also, I wanted to start sharing code snippets and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html"&gt;iPython notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, and Wordpress was appearing an awkward
choice at best for&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator
written in Python that uses ReStructuredText as the markup of choice
for articles. It took a little time to set up, but most of this was
spent trying to approximate my old blog&amp;#8217;s look by way of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dotsdl/pelican-bluemoon"&gt;custom theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in blogging with a statically-generated site through
pelican, start by installing the python module locally with&amp;nbsp;pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pip install --user pelican
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then build a skeleton that includes everything you need to get started&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pelican-quickstart
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;pelican docs&lt;/a&gt; have up-to-date information
on how to&amp;nbsp;proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since pelican generates static html files, they can be cheaply hosted. In fact,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; provides free page hosting via &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dotsdl/dotsdl.github.io"&gt;repository for my site&lt;/a&gt; and edited the Makefile included
in my pelican project directory to point to it. This allows me to regenerate
and publish my static site&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
make github
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t get much easier. I&amp;#8217;m very&amp;nbsp;pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

and the topics of the day were mainly of&amp;nbsp;interest to only 20-year-old
me. I was just coming out as gay, learning to deal with feelings I
didn&amp;#8217;t understand. I spent a lot of time thinking about religion, and
plenty of time arguing about it with others. I didn&amp;#8217;t know much about
the world, but I was trying&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now 25, and in my fourth year of graduate school. I am invested in
my research (plenty to write about on that soon), and I am in a stable
and fulfilling relationship. Grad school started out (very) rough, but
I&amp;#8217;ve found my niche. I&amp;#8217;m generally&amp;nbsp;pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided it was appropriate to start sharing my thoughts and
experiences with others. It&amp;#8217;s not something I&amp;#8217;m used to, so it may take
a post or two before I&amp;#8217;ve found&amp;nbsp;my groove. Some posts will be about
science (both content and sociology thereof) and software development;
others will chronicle my teaching and thoughts on the state of
education. Yet others will be personal updates. I think there is space
for all of this&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;david&lt;/p&gt;
